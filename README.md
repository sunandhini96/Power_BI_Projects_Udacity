# Data Visualization using Power_BI.

# Project 1: Creating a data model for Seven Sages Brewing Company (SSBC):

In this project, we'll create a data model and Power BI report for Seven Sages Brewing Company that combines information from all over the company. Our data model will make it possible for the company's CFO to quickly review and analyze what beers sell well and which ones generate the highest profitability.

# Steps follows the following diagram:

# Steps:
1. Familiarize with Source Files: Download and understand the provided source files from SSBC.
2. Design Data Model: Create a visual representation (sketch) of how the data will be structured and related.
3. Load Data into Power BI: Use "Get Data" feature in Power BI to import data from the starter materials.
4. Clean and Organize Data: Structure, combine, and clean the data to ensure it's in a usable format for analysis.
5. Establish Date Table: Create a dedicated date table to support time-related analysis and functions.
6. Establish Relationships: Link various tables by creating relationships, connecting dimensions to relevant keys in the fact table.
7. Create Required Measures: Develop six measures (formulas) for calculating Sales, Cost of Sales, and Gross Profit Margin in two different currencies as needed.
8. Develop Visual Reports: Build a basic visual report using Power BI to present and interpret the analyzed data.
