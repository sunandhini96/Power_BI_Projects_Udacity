3. What are the linear regression formulas to predict customer income from customer sales? 

- The linear regression equations are as follows: 
- To predict customer sales, the formula utilized is y = 0.0107x - 722.14.
- To predict customer incomes,the formula employed is x = (-722.14 â€“ y) / -0.0107. 

4. Which customer do you predict has the highest income? 

The individual with the highest predicted income is Jon Little, residing in Illinois, born on June 3, 1984. Over the last 6 months, he made purchases totaling $5250, and his predicted income stands at $558143.9252. 

We advise offering him the leather bag. 


5. Which product will be advertised the most?

## Some more data visualizations for better understanding: 

- Highest sales for the chronograph watch, being the product with best customer rating, and also the lowest return rate. 

- According to its $350 price and stock of 65 units, it has potential to made $22,750 sales. 

- Lowest sales for winter gloves, being the product with lowest rating and highest return rate. 

- According to its $75 price and stocks of 171 units, it has potential to made $12,825 sales.
